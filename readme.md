Thanks to all of them for making great open source tool that helped make mine to be.

## üåü Overview

Membrane provides a thin, efficient layer between your web frontend and C++ backend, enabling applications that are both beautiful and lightning-fast. Inspired by modern application frameworks but built with C++ at its core, Membrane uses native OS webviews for minimal footprint and maximum performance.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Native OS Webviews**: Minimal footprint compared to bundled browser engines
- **Blazing Fast C++ Core**: Unmatched performance for computation-heavy tasks
- **Easy Frontend Development**: Use any web framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Seamless messaging between JavaScript and C++
- **Modular Architecture**: Only include what you need to minimize application size
- **Simple API**: Clean, intuitive interfaces for both C++ and JavaScript

## Known Issues
- Windows platform is NOT WORKING. My project was tailored for Linux, and Windows fix is on the way. It is mainly a build system issue, so it should be fixed soon.
- Mac OS status is UNKNOWN. I don't have a Mac OS, so I can't test it. I did the basics, but it might not work. I will need help to fix it.
- Documentation is lacking (if not inexistant). I will work on it, but it will take time. I'm a student developer, so I don't have much time to work on this project. I will do my best to make it better.

## üîç Why Membrane?

- **Lighter than Electron**: No bundled Chromium engine means smaller, faster apps
- **C++ Foundation**: Built on the familiar, powerful C++ language
- **More Flexible**: Choose your preferred web stack and security level
- **Better Developer Experience**: Use the right tools for the right job - web tech for UI, C++ for performance

## ü§î Why Not Tauri?

Tauri is an excellent framework that shares many of Membrane's core design principles - using native webviews and separating UI from core logic.

Let's be honest - Membrane exists because I love C++ and find Rust's learning curve challenging. While Rust has amazing safety features, there's something about C++ that just clicks for me and many other developers who have spent years mastering it.

Membrane is for developers who:
- Have existing C++ codebases they want to leverage
- Feel more productive and comfortable with C++
- Prefer C++'s mature ecosystem and tooling
- Want complete control over memory management and optimization
- Need specific C++ libraries that have no Rust equivalent

Both frameworks aim to solve similar problems with different language foundations. Choose the one that best matches your skills and project requirements - there's no wrong answer!

## üöÄ Use Cases

Membrane is perfect for:

- Data-intensive applications with rich UIs
- Creative tools and media applications
- Games with web-based interfaces
- Cross-platform utilities and productivity tools
- Any project where both UI elegance and processing power matter

## Project Purpose

I decided to build Membrane to empower another open source project I'm working on (Oyster Security). I needed a way to build a cross-platform application that could handle low level operations and SDKs while still having a modern and user-friendly interface. Existing solution used Electron (too heavy), Tauri (in Rust, I'm not good at Rust), and other solutions that were proprietary or not fitting my needs.

I decided to build Membrane to solve my own problem, and I'm sharing it with the world in case it can help others. I'm not trying to compete with other projects, but rather to provide an alternative for developers who, like me, prefer C++ and want a lightweight, high-performance solution for their applications.

Arguably, Membrane is not as feature-rich as Electron or Tauri, but it's a solid foundation that can be extended and improved over time.

## ü§ù Contributing

This is my first open source project, so I'm learning as I go! I welcome contributions but please note that I might be slower than seasoned open source maintainers when it comes to reviewing and accepting PRs.

I'll personally test contributions where possible, but platform-specific improvements (especially for macOS which I don't currently have access to) may experience longer review times. Don't let this discourage you - I appreciate all help and will do my best to respond promptly.

## üåê Community

- **GitHub**: [github.com/MaximeLeBesnerais/Membrane](https://github.com/MaximeLeBesnerais/Membrane)
- **Discord**: not yet, will make one if community grows

## üìã Roadmap

Membrane is under development. 
Planned features include:

- Mac Os advanced support: I only did the basics since I don't have a Mac OS. Sorry :o
- Mobile platform support: Very far, but I will graddle this build.
