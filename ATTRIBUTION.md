# Attribution for Membrane

This project was created by Maxime Le Besnerais.

This project is released under the MIT license, which legally requires preservation of copyright and license notices. Additionally, I kindly request the following:

If you use this project in your own work, please acknowledge my original contribution in a way that makes sense for your project:

While the MIT license only strictly requires preservation of the license text, I believe in the spirit of open source and the value of acknowledging each other's work.

Thank you for respecting this request, and happy building!
